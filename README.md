# Practice and Projects

#### 24 Dec 22
This is where my practice code lives. Some projects might be in here too. 

I am primarily using starter code from Codecademy (JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React, Java, C#) and Coursera (Python, PostgreSQL) to learn back-end development. I will eventually add projects from Jon Duckett's PHP and MySQL to supplement learning more about SQL.

My evil plan is to use this knowledge to weasel into BE within a year, and then use that knowledge to perhaps weasel into the data field.

I am trying to make a sprint over the basics in the respective back-end programs via Codecademy and Coursera so that I can clear the basics I feel comfortable with over a week, so I may make several additions over this final week of the year.

I may independently create smaller projects in here initially, but if I feel like they are growing enough then I may create a separate repository.

Cheers to my burst of inspiration?? :upside_down_face:
